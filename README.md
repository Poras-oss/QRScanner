# QRScanner

I have successfully integrated a QR code and barcode scanner in my application. Users can scan codes, and the data is uploaded to Firebase Firestore with secure access through Google authentication. The main screen displays a list of decrypted data from the server. Two buttons enable code scanning and signing out or switching accounts. A network state listener ensures seamless functionality and a reliable user experience.
